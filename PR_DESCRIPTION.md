# USB/IP Core Server Implementation

## Overview
This pull request implements the USB/IP core server functionality MVP for macOS. The implementation provides the foundation for USB device sharing over IP networks, focusing on the protocol communication layer, network handling, and device enumeration capabilities.

## Features Implemented
- USB/IP protocol message encoding/decoding
- TCP server implementation using Network.framework
- IOKit-based USB device discovery and monitoring
- Command-line interface compatible with Linux usbipd
- Comprehensive logging system
- Error handling and stability improvements

## Implementation Details
The implementation follows the modular architecture outlined in the design document, with clear separation between:
- Protocol Layer: Handles USB/IP protocol message formats
- Network Layer: Manages TCP connections and data transfer
- Device Layer: Handles USB device discovery using IOKit
- CLI Layer: Provides command-line interface
- Core Server: Coordinates between all layers

## Requirements Addressed
This implementation addresses all requirements specified in the requirements document:
1. USB/IP Protocol Implementation (Requirement 1)
2. Network Communication (Requirement 2)
3. Device Discovery and Enumeration (Requirement 3)
4. Command-Line Interface (Requirement 4)
5. Logging and Diagnostics (Requirement 5)
6. Error Handling and Stability (Requirement 6)

## Testing
The implementation includes comprehensive unit tests for all components:
- Protocol encoding/decoding tests
- Network communication tests
- Device discovery tests
- CLI command parsing and execution tests
- Error handling tests

## Documentation
- Code is thoroughly documented with Swift documentation comments
- Complex algorithms and protocol-specific details include explanatory comments
- README has been updated with usage instructions

## Next Steps
While this PR implements the core server functionality, future work will focus on:
1. Actual USB device interaction using System Extensions
2. Authentication and authorization mechanisms
3. Performance optimizations
4. GUI interface

## Reviewer Notes
- Please pay special attention to the protocol implementation to ensure compatibility with the USB/IP specification
- The IOKit device discovery implementation may benefit from additional review by those familiar with IOKit
- Error handling has been implemented throughout, but edge cases may require additional consideration
