# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the need to refactor shell completion installation from a separate executable (`usbipd-install-completions`) to a proper subcommand within the main `usbipd` CLI. The current implementation creates poor user experience by introducing an additional binary that should logically be part of the main CLI interface. This refactor will improve discoverability, maintainability, and consistency with CLI best practices.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature directly supports the **Developer Experience** principle outlined in product.md by "providing clear, simple APIs and excellent documentation for integration." It also aligns with the **System Integration** goal to "work seamlessly with macOS security and permission models" by consolidating all functionality into the main CLI rather than fragmenting the user interface.

Additionally, this addresses a critical **usability issue** that impacts the overall developer productivity objective by ensuring shell completions - a key productivity feature - are discoverable and accessible through the main CLI interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using usbipd, I want to install shell completions using a command within the main CLI, so that I can easily discover and use this functionality without needing to know about additional executables.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `usbipd completion install` THEN the system SHALL generate and install shell completion scripts to appropriate user directories
2. WHEN I run `usbipd --help` THEN the system SHALL show completion subcommands in the help output for discoverability
3. WHEN I run `usbipd completion --help` THEN the system SHALL show all available completion actions including install
4. WHEN completion installation succeeds THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback about what was installed and where
5. WHEN completion installation fails THEN the system SHALL provide helpful error messages and recovery suggestions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to uninstall shell completions when needed, so that I can clean up my system or troubleshoot completion issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `usbipd completion uninstall` THEN the system SHALL remove shell completion scripts from user directories
2. WHEN uninstallation completes THEN the system SHALL confirm which files were removed
3. IF completion files don't exist THEN the system SHALL report that no completions were found to uninstall

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to check the status of installed shell completions, so that I can verify they are properly installed and functioning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `usbipd completion status` THEN the system SHALL show which completion files exist and their locations
2. WHEN completion files exist THEN the system SHALL verify they are valid and up-to-date
3. WHEN completion files are outdated THEN the system SHALL suggest reinstalling them

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator managing Homebrew installations, I want the Homebrew formula to provide clear instructions for completion installation, so that users understand how to enable shell completions after installation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Homebrew installation completes THEN the system SHALL display post-install message with clear completion installation instructions
2. WHEN the post-install message is shown THEN it SHALL use the new `usbipd completion install` command syntax
3. WHEN the Homebrew formula is updated THEN the separate `usbipd-install-completions` executable SHALL be removed

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want backward compatibility during the transition, so that existing documentation and scripts continue to work temporarily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. IF the old `usbipd-install-completions` command exists THEN it SHALL display a deprecation warning and redirect to the new command
2. WHEN the old command is run THEN it SHALL still function but inform users of the preferred new approach
3. WHEN the transition period ends THEN the old executable SHALL be completely removed from the formula

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each completion command action (install, uninstall, status) should be a separate, focused function
- **Modular Design**: Completion installation logic should be reusable between the CLI command and potential future integrations
- **Dependency Management**: Completion functionality should remain within the existing CLI module without introducing new dependencies
- **Clear Interfaces**: Clean separation between completion command parsing, installation logic, and shell script generation

### Performance
- Completion installation SHALL complete within 5 seconds under normal conditions
- Status checking SHALL complete within 1 second
- Memory usage SHALL not exceed 50MB during completion operations

### Security
- Completion files SHALL only be written to user-specific directories, never system-wide locations
- File permissions SHALL be set appropriately (644 for completion scripts)
- The system SHALL validate user directory paths before writing files
- No shell script execution during installation beyond path validation

### Reliability
- Installation SHALL handle missing user directories by creating them with appropriate permissions
- The system SHALL gracefully handle file system errors (permission denied, disk full, etc.)
- Completion generation SHALL work whether or not the system extension is available
- All file operations SHALL be atomic to prevent partial installation states

### Usability
- Command syntax SHALL follow CLI best practices and be intuitive to discover
- Error messages SHALL be actionable and include specific next steps
- Success messages SHALL clearly indicate what was accomplished and where files were placed
- Help text SHALL be comprehensive and include usage examples
