# Production Release Monitoring Plan

## External Tap Integration - First Production Release Validation

**Task:** Task 35 - Monitor and validate first production release  
**Status:** In Progress  
**Created:** 2025-08-20  

## Overview

This document outlines the monitoring and validation plan for the first production release using the new external tap repository architecture. The integration has been successfully merged into main, and we now need to monitor the first release to ensure the workflow operates correctly.

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Pre-Requisites
- [x] PR #24 merged into main branch
- [x] All infrastructure components deployed
- [x] Metadata generation scripts validated and tested
- [x] Integration tests passing
- [x] Deployment checklist created

### üìã Monitoring Targets

#### 1. Release Workflow Monitoring
**Scope:** Monitor GitHub Actions workflow execution during next release

**Key Metrics:**
- Release workflow execution time
- Metadata generation success rate
- Build artifact creation success
- GitHub release creation success

**Validation Steps:**
```bash
# 1. Monitor release workflow
gh workflow list --repo beriberikix/usbipd-mac
gh run watch [RUN_ID] # When release is triggered

# 2. Validate metadata generation
gh release view v[VERSION] --repo beriberikix/usbipd-mac
gh release download v[VERSION] --pattern "homebrew-metadata.json" --repo beriberikix/usbipd-mac

# 3. Verify metadata content
./Scripts/validate-homebrew-metadata.sh homebrew-metadata.json
```

#### 2. Webhook Delivery Monitoring
**Scope:** Monitor webhook delivery from main repo to tap repository

**Key Metrics:**
- Webhook delivery success rate
- Webhook payload validation
- Response time from release to webhook delivery

**Validation Steps:**
```bash
# 1. Check webhook deliveries
gh api repos/beriberikix/usbipd-mac/hooks

# 2. Monitor tap repository workflow
gh run list --repo beriberikix/homebrew-usbipd-mac

# 3. Verify webhook payload processing
gh run watch [TAP_WORKFLOW_RUN_ID] --repo beriberikix/homebrew-usbipd-mac
```

#### 3. Formula Update Validation
**Scope:** Monitor automatic formula updates in tap repository

**Key Metrics:**
- Formula update completion time
- Checksum verification success
- Formula syntax validation success
- Git commit and push success

**Validation Steps:**
```bash
# 1. Monitor formula file changes
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beriberikix/homebrew-usbipd-mac/main/Formula/usbipd-mac.rb

# 2. Verify version and checksum updates
grep -E "(version|sha256)" Formula/usbipd-mac.rb

# 3. Test formula syntax
brew audit --strict Formula/usbipd-mac.rb
```

#### 4. End-User Experience Validation
**Scope:** Validate complete user installation workflow

**Key Metrics:**
- Tap addition success rate
- Formula installation success rate
- System Extension functionality
- Service management functionality

**Validation Steps:**
```bash
# 1. Fresh installation test
brew untap beriberikix/usbipd-mac 2>/dev/null || true
brew tap beriberikix/usbipd-mac
brew install usbipd-mac

# 2. Functionality validation
usbipd --version
usbipd-install-extension status

# 3. Service management test
sudo brew services start usbipd-mac
brew services list | grep usbipd-mac
sudo brew services stop usbipd-mac
```
