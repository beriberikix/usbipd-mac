# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The usbipd-mac project currently has a complex CI system with 7 different GitHub Actions workflows that have overlapping responsibilities, redundant steps, and unclear boundaries. This specification aims to consolidate and simplify the CI system while maintaining all essential functionality, improving maintainability, and ensuring reliable validation for all scenarios including the recently-introduced release flow.

The cleanup will focus on eliminating duplication, creating clear workflow boundaries, optimizing performance through better caching and parallelization, and ensuring comprehensive coverage while ignoring manual tests that require real hardware access.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature directly supports the project's technical excellence goals by:
- **Reducing Development Friction**: Streamlined CI reduces confusion and wait times for contributors
- **Improving Release Reliability**: Clear, consolidated release validation ensures production quality
- **Enhancing Maintainability**: Simplified workflow structure reduces maintenance overhead
- **Supporting Rapid Development**: Faster, more efficient CI enables quicker iteration cycles

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Workflow Consolidation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simplified CI system with clear workflow boundaries, so that I can understand what each workflow does and when it runs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the GitHub Actions workflows THEN there SHALL be exactly 3 core workflows: main CI, release, and security
2. WHEN a pull request is opened THEN the main CI workflow SHALL run all necessary validation steps
3. WHEN a release tag is pushed THEN the release workflow SHALL run comprehensive validation and artifact creation
4. IF workflow boundaries are unclear THEN each workflow SHALL have distinct, non-overlapping responsibilities

### Requirement 2: Comprehensive Test Coverage

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want all test scenarios to be covered efficiently, so that code quality and functionality are validated without redundancy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CI runs THEN all environment-based tests (development, CI, production) SHALL be executed appropriately
2. WHEN tests run in CI environment THEN hardware-dependent tests SHALL be automatically skipped or mocked
3. WHEN production tests run THEN manual hardware tests SHALL be excluded from automated validation
4. IF test environments are not available THEN tests SHALL gracefully degrade with appropriate warnings

### Requirement 3: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want fast CI feedback, so that I can iterate quickly and receive timely validation results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN workflows run THEN duplicate steps between workflows SHALL be eliminated
2. WHEN building or testing THEN caching SHALL be optimized for maximum effectiveness
3. WHEN jobs can run independently THEN they SHALL execute in parallel
4. IF optimization is possible THEN workflow execution time SHALL be minimized without compromising coverage

### Requirement 4: Release Flow Integration

**User Story:** As a release manager, I want seamless integration between CI validation and release processes, so that releases are reliable and well-validated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a release is triggered THEN all necessary validation SHALL complete before artifact creation
2. WHEN release validation runs THEN it SHALL reuse CI validation results when possible
3. WHEN release workflows complete THEN they SHALL integrate cleanly with existing release automation
4. IF release validation fails THEN clear feedback SHALL be provided about required fixes

### Requirement 5: Documentation and Clarity

**User Story:** As a contributor, I want clear documentation about CI workflows, so that I understand how to use them effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN workflows are updated THEN documentation SHALL be updated to reflect changes
2. WHEN new workflows are created THEN their purpose and usage SHALL be clearly documented
3. WHEN CI fails THEN error messages SHALL provide actionable guidance
4. IF workflow behavior changes THEN migration guidance SHALL be provided

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Workflow Reusability**: Common steps should be extracted into reusable composite actions
- **Configuration Management**: Workflow parameters should be centralized and consistently applied
- **Error Handling**: Workflows should handle failures gracefully with clear reporting
- **Maintenance Simplicity**: Workflow logic should be straightforward and well-documented

### Performance
- **Execution Time**: Total CI time for PRs should be under 10 minutes for standard validation
- **Cache Efficiency**: Build caches should achieve >80% hit rate for common scenarios
- **Parallel Execution**: Independent jobs should run concurrently to minimize total time
- **Resource Usage**: Workflows should optimize runner usage and avoid unnecessary resource consumption

### Security
- **Secret Management**: All secrets should be properly scoped and securely accessed
- **Permission Isolation**: Workflows should use minimum required permissions
- **Audit Trail**: All CI actions should be logged and traceable
- **Vulnerability Detection**: Security scanning should be integrated without blocking development flow

### Reliability
- **Failure Recovery**: Workflows should be resilient to transient failures
- **Deterministic Results**: CI should produce consistent results across runs
- **Environment Isolation**: Test environments should not interfere with each other
- **Rollback Capability**: Changes should be easily reversible if issues arise

### Usability
- **Clear Status Reporting**: Workflow status should be easily understandable
- **Actionable Feedback**: Failures should provide specific guidance for resolution
- **Documentation Integration**: Workflow documentation should be embedded and accessible
- **Developer Experience**: CI should enhance rather than hinder development workflow
