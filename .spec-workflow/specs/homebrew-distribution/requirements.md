# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for implementing Homebrew distribution for usbipd-mac, enabling users to install and manage the USB/IP daemon through Homebrew's package management system. The implementation will follow Homebrew's tap-based distribution model, where users must first tap a custom repository before accessing the formula, providing controlled distribution while maintaining accessibility for the developer community.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature directly supports the product objective of **Developer Productivity** by eliminating installation friction for macOS developers who need USB device sharing capabilities. It aligns with the **Open Source Leadership** goal by establishing the canonical installation method for usbipd-mac and supports **Community Growth** by providing a familiar installation experience for macOS developers who expect Homebrew integration for system utilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a macOS developer, I want to install usbipd-mac using Homebrew so that I can manage it alongside my other development tools using a familiar package manager.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs `brew tap <organization>/usbipd-mac` THEN the system SHALL add the custom tap to their Homebrew configuration
2. WHEN a user runs `brew install usbipd-mac` after tapping THEN the system SHALL install the usbipd binary to `/usr/local/bin` or `/opt/homebrew/bin` based on their Homebrew installation
3. WHEN the installation completes THEN the usbipd command SHALL be available in the user's PATH for immediate use
4. WHEN a user runs `brew install usbipd-mac` without tapping first THEN Homebrew SHALL display an error indicating the formula is not found in default repositories

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Homebrew formula to handle all necessary dependencies and permissions so that the installed daemon functions correctly without additional manual configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the formula installs THEN it SHALL install the main usbipd executable with proper permissions
2. WHEN the formula installs THEN it SHALL install the QEMUTestServer utility for development and testing scenarios
3. WHEN the formula installs THEN it SHALL provide clear installation instructions for System Extension setup that requires manual user approval
4. IF the user's system is macOS 11+ THEN the formula SHALL install successfully and warn about System Extension requirements
5. WHEN installation completes THEN all installed binaries SHALL have executable permissions and be properly code-signed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to easily update usbipd-mac through Homebrew so that I can stay current with the latest features and security updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs `brew update && brew upgrade usbipd-mac` THEN the system SHALL check for and install the latest version if available
2. WHEN a new version is available THEN the upgrade process SHALL preserve existing configuration and gracefully handle daemon restart
3. WHEN upgrading THEN the system SHALL display relevant release notes and any breaking changes that require user attention
4. WHEN the upgrade completes THEN the previous version SHALL be cleanly uninstalled and the new version SHALL be immediately functional

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want the Homebrew formula to be automatically updated when new releases are published so that users receive timely access to updates without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new Git tag matching pattern `v*` is pushed to the main repository THEN the release automation SHALL generate updated formula with new version and checksum
2. WHEN the release automation runs THEN it SHALL commit the updated formula to the tap repository with appropriate commit message
3. WHEN the formula is updated THEN it SHALL include accurate download URL, SHA256 checksum, and version metadata
4. IF the automated formula update fails THEN the system SHALL notify maintainers and provide rollback capabilities

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to uninstall usbipd-mac cleanly through Homebrew so that all components are properly removed from my system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs `brew uninstall usbipd-mac` THEN the system SHALL remove all installed binaries and their symlinks
2. WHEN uninstalling THEN the system SHALL display instructions for manually removing the System Extension if it was installed
3. WHEN uninstalling THEN the system SHALL preserve user configuration files and logs for potential reinstallation
4. WHEN the uninstall completes THEN no usbipd-mac components SHALL remain in Homebrew-managed directories

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage the usbipd daemon as a system service through Homebrew so that it can start automatically and be managed consistently with other services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the formula installs THEN it SHALL provide a launchd plist file for daemon management
2. WHEN a user runs `brew services start usbipd-mac` THEN the daemon SHALL start and register for automatic startup on system boot
3. WHEN a user runs `brew services stop usbipd-mac` THEN the daemon SHALL stop gracefully and disable automatic startup
4. WHEN the daemon is running as a service THEN it SHALL log to standard macOS logging locations accessible via Console.app or log show command

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Homebrew Integration**: Formula must follow Homebrew's established patterns and conventions for Swift-based packages
- **Release Automation**: Integration with existing GitHub Actions workflows for automated formula publishing
- **Tap Repository Structure**: Clean separation between main project repository and Homebrew tap repository
- **Version Management**: Automated synchronization between Git tags and formula version declarations

### Performance
- **Installation Speed**: Formula installation must complete within 5 minutes on typical macOS systems
- **Binary Size**: Installed binaries should maintain current size profile (~50MB total) for reasonable download times
- **Startup Performance**: Homebrew-installed daemon must maintain existing sub-5-second startup performance

### Security
- **Code Signing**: All installed binaries must maintain proper Apple Developer ID signatures for System Extension compatibility
- **Checksum Validation**: Formula must include SHA256 checksums for all downloaded artifacts to ensure integrity
- **Permission Model**: Installation process must respect macOS security model and prompt for necessary permissions
- **Tap Security**: Custom tap repository must implement branch protection and secure access controls

### Reliability
- **Formula Validation**: Automated testing to ensure formula correctness before publication
- **Rollback Capability**: Ability to revert to previous formula versions if issues are discovered
- **Dependency Stability**: Reliable installation across different macOS versions (11.0+) and Homebrew configurations
- **Error Recovery**: Clear error messages and recovery instructions for common installation failures

### Usability
- **Installation Documentation**: Clear instructions for tapping and installing the formula
- **System Extension Guidance**: Comprehensive documentation for System Extension approval process
- **Service Management**: Intuitive commands for starting, stopping, and monitoring the daemon service
- **Troubleshooting Support**: Integration with existing project documentation and diagnostic tools
