# Implementation Plan

## Task Overview
Implementation of Homebrew distribution follows a phased approach that integrates the Homebrew formula directly into the main repository and extends existing GitHub Actions workflows. The implementation leverages the current Swift Package Manager build system and release automation infrastructure while adding formula validation and automated updates. The workflow follows standard Git practices with feature branch development, incremental commits, and pull request integration.
