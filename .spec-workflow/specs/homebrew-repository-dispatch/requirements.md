# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the need to replace the current homebrew-releaser GitHub Action with a more reliable repository dispatch-based approach for updating the Homebrew tap repository. The current homebrew-releaser implementation has limitations in supporting binary downloads and lacks the flexibility needed for our release workflow, which distributes pre-built binaries rather than source code compilation.

The new solution will use repository dispatch events to trigger formula updates in the tap repository whenever a new release is published, providing better control, reliability, and maintainability compared to the existing homebrew-releaser action.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature supports the project's goal of providing automated, reliable release distribution through Homebrew package management. By implementing a robust tap repository update mechanism, we ensure users can seamlessly upgrade to new versions while maintaining the integrity of our pre-built binary distribution model.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Repository Dispatch Integration

**User Story:** As a release automation system, I want to trigger tap repository updates via repository dispatch events, so that formula updates are decoupled from the main release workflow and can be independently managed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a release is successfully created THEN the system SHALL dispatch a repository_dispatch event to the tap repository
2. WHEN the repository_dispatch event is triggered THEN the tap repository SHALL receive release metadata including version, binary download URL, and SHA256 checksum
3. WHEN the dispatch payload is malformed or missing required fields THEN the tap repository SHALL log an error and exit gracefully without making changes

### Requirement 2: Formula Update Automation

**User Story:** As a Homebrew tap maintainer, I want the formula to be automatically updated with new release information, so that users can install the latest version without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a repository_dispatch event is received THEN the system SHALL extract the binary download URL and calculate its SHA256 checksum
2. WHEN updating the formula THEN the system SHALL replace the version number, URL, and SHA256 fields with the new release information
3. WHEN the formula update is complete THEN the system SHALL commit the changes with a descriptive commit message
4. IF the binary download fails or checksum calculation fails THEN the system SHALL abort the update and create an issue for manual investigation

### Requirement 3: Error Handling and Validation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive error handling and validation during formula updates, so that failed updates don't corrupt the tap repository or leave it in an inconsistent state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dispatch payload is received THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields (version, download_url, sha256) are present and properly formatted
2. WHEN downloading the binary for validation THEN the system SHALL verify the download URL is accessible and the file size is reasonable
3. WHEN calculating SHA256 THEN the system SHALL verify the calculated checksum matches the expected format (64-character hexadecimal string)
4. IF any validation step fails THEN the system SHALL create a detailed GitHub issue with error information and troubleshooting context
5. WHEN a formula update fails THEN the system SHALL NOT commit partial changes and SHALL restore the repository to its previous state

### Requirement 4: Binary Download Support

**User Story:** As a Homebrew formula, I want to download and install pre-built binaries instead of compiling from source, so that installation is faster and doesn't require development tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the formula is processed THEN it SHALL download the specified binary asset from GitHub releases
2. WHEN installing the binary THEN it SHALL be placed in the appropriate bin directory with correct permissions
3. WHEN the binary is downloaded THEN its SHA256 checksum SHALL be verified against the expected value
4. IF the checksum verification fails THEN the installation SHALL abort with a clear error message

### Requirement 5: GitHub Actions Integration

**User Story:** As a release workflow, I want to integrate with peter-evans/repository-dispatch action, so that repository dispatch events are sent reliably with proper authentication and payload structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN triggering a repository dispatch THEN the system SHALL use the peter-evans/repository-dispatch action for reliable event delivery
2. WHEN authenticating with the tap repository THEN the system SHALL use a GitHub token with appropriate repository access permissions
3. WHEN constructing the dispatch payload THEN the system SHALL include all required metadata (version, download_url, sha256, release_notes)
4. IF the repository dispatch fails THEN the system SHALL retry once and create an issue if the retry also fails

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each script should have a single, well-defined purpose (dispatch sending vs. formula updating)
- **Modular Design**: Formula update logic should be isolated and reusable for manual operations
- **Dependency Management**: Minimize dependencies on external tools and provide fallbacks
- **Clear Interfaces**: Define clean contracts between the dispatch sender and receiver workflows

### Performance
- Formula updates should complete within 2 minutes under normal conditions
- Binary download verification should not exceed 30 seconds for reasonably-sized binaries
- The dispatch mechanism should not introduce more than 10 seconds of additional latency

### Security
- Repository tokens must be stored as GitHub Secrets and never logged or exposed
- Binary downloads must be verified with SHA256 checksums before installation
- Formula updates must be atomic (complete success or complete rollback)
- All external URLs must be validated before making network requests

### Reliability
- The system should handle transient network failures with automatic retry mechanisms
- Failed updates should not leave the tap repository in an inconsistent state
- Error conditions should be logged with sufficient detail for troubleshooting
- The dispatch mechanism should work reliably across GitHub's infrastructure

### Usability
- Error messages should be clear and actionable for repository maintainers
- Manual formula updates should be possible using the same scripts as automated updates
- The system should provide clear status indicators during long-running operations
