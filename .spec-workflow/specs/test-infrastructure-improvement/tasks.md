# Implementation Plan

## Task Overview

This implementation transforms the current complex test infrastructure into a streamlined, environment-based testing system. The approach consolidates 15+ test files and 16+ scripts into a focused 6-file, 6-script structure organized around three execution environments: Development, CI, and Production/Release. Each task includes explicit git commit commands with specific commit messages.
