# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The usbipd-mac project currently has a comprehensive but complex test infrastructure with significant redundancy and overlap between test files and scripts. The current testing system includes 15+ test files across multiple directories and 16+ scripts with overlapping functionality. This improvement focuses on consolidating, streamlining, and optimizing the test infrastructure to reduce maintenance overhead while maintaining comprehensive coverage organized around execution environments: development, CI, and production/release preparation.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This improvement supports the goals of creating a production-ready, maintainable USB/IP implementation by:
- Organizing tests around execution environments (development, CI, production/release)
- Reducing test maintenance overhead through elimination of redundancy
- Enabling different test strategies for different environments and constraints
- Improving developer productivity with fast, focused development tests
- Ensuring reliable CI execution despite hardware access limitations
- Providing comprehensive production-readiness validation

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Environment-Based Test Organization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests organized by execution environment, so that I can run appropriate tests for my current context (development, CI, or release preparation).

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing tests THEN the system SHALL have three primary execution environments: Development, CI, and Production/Release
2. WHEN running development tests THEN they SHALL execute quickly with minimal dependencies for rapid feedback during feature development
3. WHEN running CI tests THEN they SHALL work without hardware access or System Extension installation requirements
4. WHEN running production/release tests THEN they SHALL provide comprehensive validation including hardware-dependent functionality
5. IF tests require hardware access THEN they SHALL be classified as Development or Production/Release tests

### Requirement 2: Development Environment Test Suite

**User Story:** As a developer writing new features, I want fast, focused tests, so that I can get immediate feedback without waiting for comprehensive validation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running development tests THEN execution time SHALL not exceed 1 minute
2. WHEN writing new features THEN relevant unit tests SHALL execute in under 30 seconds
3. WHEN testing components THEN development tests SHALL use mocks and stubs for external dependencies
4. IF hardware access is needed THEN development tests SHALL use mock implementations
5. WHEN validating logic THEN development tests SHALL focus on core business logic and component interactions

### Requirement 3: CI Environment Test Suite

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reliable CI tests that work in automated environments, so that pull requests can be validated without hardware dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running in CI THEN tests SHALL not require actual USB devices, System Extension installation, or administrative privileges
2. WHEN executing CI tests THEN all external dependencies SHALL be mocked or stubbed
3. WHEN validating in CI THEN tests SHALL focus on protocol compliance, network communication, and component integration
4. IF System Extension functionality exists THEN CI tests SHALL validate bundle creation and code signing without installation
5. WHEN running CI suite THEN execution time SHALL not exceed 3 minutes on standard GitHub Actions infrastructure

### Requirement 4: Production/Release Test Suite

**User Story:** As a developer preparing for release, I want comprehensive validation tests, so that I can ensure the system works correctly with real hardware and System Extensions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN preparing for release THEN production tests SHALL validate actual USB device discovery and System Extension integration
2. WHEN running production tests THEN they SHALL test real hardware interactions when available
3. WHEN validating release readiness THEN tests SHALL include QEMU integration and end-to-end workflows
4. IF hardware is available THEN production tests SHALL validate actual device claiming and USB/IP communication
5. WHEN running production suite THEN comprehensive validation MAY take up to 10 minutes for thorough testing

### Requirement 5: Test File Consolidation by Environment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear test file organization by environment, so that I can easily run the right tests for my current needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining test structure THEN there SHALL be separate test files for each environment: `DevelopmentTests.swift`, `CITests.swift`, `ProductionTests.swift`
2. WHEN organizing existing tests THEN duplicate functionality SHALL be eliminated between QEMU validation test files
3. WHEN consolidating tests THEN shared utilities SHALL be extracted to `TestUtilities.swift`
4. IF integration testing exists THEN it SHALL be distributed appropriately across environment-specific test files
5. WHEN running tests THEN each environment SHALL have a clear, single entry point

### Requirement 6: Script Consolidation by Environment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want environment-specific test scripts, so that I can easily run appropriate tests for my context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining scripts THEN there SHALL be exactly 3 primary test execution scripts: `run-development-tests.sh`, `run-ci-tests.sh`, `run-production-tests.sh`
2. WHEN running development tests THEN the script SHALL execute unit tests with mocked dependencies
3. WHEN running CI tests THEN the script SHALL execute tests suitable for GitHub Actions environment
4. WHEN running production tests THEN the script SHALL execute comprehensive validation including QEMU integration
5. IF utility scripts exist THEN there SHALL be no more than 3 additional support scripts

### Requirement 7: Environment-Aware Mock Strategy

**User Story:** As a developer, I want appropriate mocking for each environment, so that tests run reliably in their intended context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running development tests THEN all IOKit, System Extension, and hardware dependencies SHALL be mocked
2. WHEN running CI tests THEN network and system dependencies SHALL be mocked, but protocol logic SHALL be real
3. WHEN running production tests THEN mocking SHALL be minimal to test actual system integration
4. IF mocks are needed THEN they SHALL be organized by environment in `TestMocks/Development`, `TestMocks/CI`, `TestMocks/Production`
5. WHEN creating mocks THEN they SHALL be shared across test files within the same environment

### Requirement 8: Core Feature Coverage Across Environments

**User Story:** As a developer, I want confidence that core features are tested appropriately in each environment, so that I know the system works reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing USB device discovery THEN development tests SHALL validate logic with mocks, CI tests SHALL validate protocol handling, production tests SHALL validate real device interaction
2. WHEN testing System Extension integration THEN development tests SHALL validate bundle creation logic, CI tests SHALL validate bundle structure and signing, production tests SHALL validate actual installation
3. WHEN testing USB/IP protocol THEN development tests SHALL validate message encoding/decoding, CI tests SHALL validate network communication, production tests SHALL validate end-to-end communication
4. WHEN testing network communication THEN all environments SHALL have appropriate coverage with environment-specific dependencies
5. IF new features are added THEN they SHALL include tests in all relevant environments

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Environment Separation**: Each test environment should have isolated dependencies and utilities
- **Modular Design**: Test utilities should be reusable within environments but separated across environments
