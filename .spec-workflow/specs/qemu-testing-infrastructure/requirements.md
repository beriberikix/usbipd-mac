# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the re-introduction of QEMU testing infrastructure for usbipd-mac to enable comprehensive end-to-end testing of the USB/IP protocol implementation. The feature will provide minimal QEMU testing capabilities that support real device testing during development and mock testing in CI environments.

The current codebase has a placeholder QEMUTestServer and validation utilities but lacks the actual QEMU VM management capabilities that existed in the feature/system-extension-installation branch. This implementation will restore and enhance those capabilities with a focus on simplicity and reliability.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature supports the project's testing strategy by providing:
- Comprehensive end-to-end validation of USB/IP protocol implementation
- Environment-aware testing that adapts to development, CI, and production contexts
- Real device testing capabilities for development workflows
- Mock testing capabilities for automated CI validation

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: QEMU VM Lifecycle Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create and manage QEMU VMs for USB/IP testing, so that I can validate protocol implementation end-to-end

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs QEMU test setup THEN the system SHALL create a minimal Linux VM with USB/IP client capabilities
2. WHEN VM startup is initiated THEN the system SHALL boot the VM within 30 seconds in development mode
3. WHEN VM is no longer needed THEN the system SHALL cleanly shutdown and cleanup VM resources
4. IF VM fails to start THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and cleanup partial resources
5. WHEN VM is running THEN the system SHALL provide status information including IP address and readiness state

### Requirement 2: Environment-Aware Test Execution

**User Story:** As a developer and CI system, I want QEMU testing to adapt to different environments, so that tests run efficiently in development and reliably in CI

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running in development environment THEN the system SHALL use real USB devices if available and fallback to mocks gracefully
2. WHEN running in CI environment THEN the system SHALL use mock devices and skip hardware-dependent tests
3. WHEN running in production environment THEN the system SHALL execute comprehensive tests with both real and simulated devices
4. IF environment cannot be detected THEN the system SHALL default to development mode with warnings
5. WHEN environment variables are set THEN the system SHALL override automatic detection

### Requirement 3: USB/IP Client Validation

**User Story:** As a tester, I want to validate USB/IP client functionality within QEMU VMs, so that I can verify protocol correctness

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN QEMU VM starts THEN the system SHALL verify USB/IP client tools are available and functional
2. WHEN USB/IP server is running THEN the VM client SHALL successfully connect and list devices
3. WHEN device operations are requested THEN the system SHALL validate import/export operations complete successfully
4. IF client validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error details and suggested remediation
5. WHEN test completion occurs THEN the system SHALL generate structured test reports

### Requirement 4: Minimal Script Interface

**User Story:** As a developer, I want simple scripts to manage QEMU testing, so that I can integrate testing into development workflows

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developer needs QEMU testing THEN the system SHALL provide a single entry-point script
2. WHEN script is executed THEN it SHALL handle VM creation, testing, and cleanup automatically
3. WHEN script parameters are provided THEN it SHALL support custom test scenarios and timeouts
4. IF script execution fails THEN it SHALL provide clear error messages and cleanup instructions
5. WHEN script completes THEN it SHALL exit with appropriate status codes for automation

### Requirement 5: Integration with Existing Test Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want QEMU testing to integrate with existing test framework, so that it fits naturally into the current testing strategy

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing test scripts are run THEN QEMU tests SHALL be invokable through current test execution patterns
2. WHEN QEMU validation is needed THEN it SHALL utilize existing qemu-test-validation.sh utilities
3. WHEN test reports are generated THEN they SHALL follow existing reporting formats and conventions
4. IF QEMU testing is unavailable THEN existing tests SHALL continue to function without degradation
5. WHEN Swift test suite runs THEN it SHALL optionally include QEMU integration tests based on environment

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each script should focus on one aspect of QEMU testing (creation, management, validation)
- **Modular Design**: QEMU components should be isolated and reusable across different test scenarios
- **Dependency Management**: Minimize external dependencies beyond standard tools (QEMU, bash, swift)
- **Clear Interfaces**: Define clean contracts between QEMU management and test validation components

### Performance
- **VM Startup Time**: QEMU VMs must start within 30 seconds in development mode, 60 seconds in CI
- **Resource Usage**: VMs should use minimal RAM (≤512MB) and disk space (≤1GB) for CI compatibility
- **Test Execution Time**: Complete QEMU test cycles should complete within environment-specific timeouts
- **Parallel Execution**: Support running multiple test scenarios concurrently when resources allow

### Security
- **VM Isolation**: QEMU VMs must run in isolated environments with minimal host system access
- **Network Security**: VM networking should be restricted to test-specific communication only
- **Credential Management**: No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data in VM images or scripts
- **Host Protection**: VM failures must not compromise host system stability or security

### Reliability
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error detection and recovery for VM lifecycle operations
- **Resource Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of VM resources on both successful and failed test runs
- **State Validation**: Verify VM and test state at each critical step with appropriate timeouts
- **Graceful Degradation**: Tests should continue with reduced functionality if QEMU is unavailable

### Usability
- **Simple Interface**: Single command execution for common QEMU testing scenarios
- **Clear Feedback**: Informative progress messages and error reporting throughout test execution
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive usage examples and troubleshooting guidance
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing development and CI workflows
