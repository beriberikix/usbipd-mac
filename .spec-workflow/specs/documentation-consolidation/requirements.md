# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature consolidates all documentation files into a unified Documentation folder structure and refocuses the README.md to serve end users (those building releases or using the project) while moving developer-focused content to appropriate documentation files. The goal is to improve documentation discoverability, reduce README complexity, and create a clear separation between user-facing and developer-facing documentation.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature supports the project's goal of providing a professional, user-friendly macOS USB/IP implementation by ensuring documentation is well-organized and accessible. Clear documentation structure improves adoption and reduces support overhead.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Documentation Consolidation

**User Story:** As a project contributor, I want all documentation consolidated in a single Documentation folder, so that I can easily find and maintain all project documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the project structure THEN all documentation files SHALL be located within the Documentation/ folder
2. WHEN existing documentation files are moved THEN they SHALL maintain their content integrity and internal links
3. WHEN documentation is consolidated THEN there SHALL be no duplicate documentation across the codebase
4. WHEN a user browses the Documentation folder THEN they SHALL find a clear organization with logical groupings

### Requirement 2: README Refocus for End Users

**User Story:** As an end user wanting to build or use usbipd-mac, I want a README focused on installation, building, and usage, so that I can quickly get started without developer implementation details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reading the README THEN it SHALL contain installation instructions for end users
2. WHEN an end user needs to build from source THEN the README SHALL provide clear build instructions
3. WHEN looking for usage examples THEN the README SHALL include basic usage scenarios
4. WHEN the README contains development content THEN it SHALL be limited to essential build/test commands only
5. WHEN an end user reads the README THEN they SHALL NOT see detailed implementation discussions, architecture details, or internal development workflows

### Requirement 3: Developer Documentation Migration

**User Story:** As a developer contributing to the project, I want detailed development information moved to appropriate documentation files, so that I can access comprehensive development guidance without cluttering the user-focused README.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developer-focused content is moved THEN it SHALL be organized in logical documentation files within Documentation/
2. WHEN CI/CD information is relocated THEN it SHALL be in Documentation/development/ci-cd.md
3. WHEN architecture information is moved THEN it SHALL be in Documentation/development/architecture.md
4. WHEN troubleshooting information is relocated THEN it SHALL be in Documentation/troubleshooting.md
5. WHEN API documentation exists THEN it SHALL be in Documentation/api/
6. WHEN development workflow information is moved THEN it SHALL include clear cross-references from the README

### Requirement 4: Clear Navigation Structure

**User Story:** As any user of the documentation, I want a clear navigation structure, so that I can quickly find the information I need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN browsing Documentation/ THEN there SHALL be a Documentation/README.md that serves as a navigation guide
2. WHEN looking for specific information THEN documentation files SHALL have descriptive names and clear purposes
3. WHEN documentation is categorized THEN it SHALL use logical folder structures (e.g., development/, api/, troubleshooting/)
4. WHEN cross-references exist THEN they SHALL use relative paths that work in both GitHub and local viewing
5. WHEN the main README references detailed documentation THEN it SHALL provide clear links to specific Documentation/ files

### Requirement 5: Content Integrity and Linking

**User Story:** As a user following documentation links, I want all internal references to work correctly, so that I can navigate seamlessly between related documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation files are moved THEN all internal links SHALL be updated to new locations
2. WHEN README.md references detailed documentation THEN links SHALL point to correct Documentation/ locations
3. WHEN documentation contains code examples THEN they SHALL remain accurate and functional
4. WHEN CLAUDE.md references are updated THEN they SHALL point to new Documentation/ locations
5. WHEN external tools reference documentation THEN migration SHALL not break existing workflows

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Documentation Structure**: Clear separation between user documentation and developer documentation
- **Maintainability**: Documentation organization that supports easy updates and additions
- **Discoverability**: Logical file naming and folder structure for intuitive navigation

### Performance
- Documentation structure changes SHALL NOT impact build or runtime performance
- Link validation SHALL complete within reasonable timeframes during CI

### Security  
- No security-sensitive information SHALL be moved to more prominent locations
- Development-specific security notes SHALL remain in developer documentation

### Reliability
- All moved documentation SHALL maintain content accuracy
- Link integrity SHALL be preserved across all documentation files
- Build and test instructions SHALL remain functional

### Usability
- README SHALL be scannable for quick orientation by new users
- Documentation navigation SHALL be intuitive for both technical and non-technical users
- Essential information SHALL be easily discoverable without deep navigation
