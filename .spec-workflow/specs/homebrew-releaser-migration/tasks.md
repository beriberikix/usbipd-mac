# Implementation Plan

## Task Overview

This implementation plan migrates from webhook-based Homebrew formula updates to using the homebrew-releaser GitHub Action. The approach follows a safe, phased migration with validation at each step, proper Git workflow management, and CI validation to ensure reliability and maintain user experience continuity.

## Tasks

- [x] 1. Create feature branch and commit specification documents
  - Files: Git repository, .spec-workflow/specs/homebrew-releaser-migration/
  - Create feature branch: git checkout -b feature/homebrew-releaser-migration

    • Homebrew-releaser job missing from recent release runs (v0.0.12, v0.0.13)
    • Webhook system failing in tap repository (workflow file issues)
    • Formula outdated at v0.0.11 while latest release is v0.0.13
