# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The System Extension functionality in usbipd-mac is currently failing due to critical bugs in bundle detection and bundle generation. The System Extension installation fails with `SystemExtensionSubmissionError error 1` because the bundle detector incorrectly identifies debug symbols (dSYM) as the System Extension bundle, and the build system doesn't generate proper `.systemextension` bundles required by macOS.

This feature addresses these core infrastructure issues to enable reliable System Extension installation and USB device claiming functionality.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature directly supports the key product objectives:
- **System Extensions Integration**: Enable reliable device access and claiming through macOS System Extensions
- **Developer Productivity**: Eliminate friction in development workflows requiring System Extension functionality
- **Production Ready**: Focus on reliability and production deployment scenarios

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the System Extension bundle detection to work correctly in development environments, so that I can install and test System Extensions locally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bundle detector searches for System Extension bundles THEN it SHALL exclude dSYM directories from bundle detection
2. WHEN a USBIPDSystemExtension executable is found in a dSYM directory THEN the system SHALL not return the dSYM path as a valid bundle
3. WHEN the bundle detector finds the actual USBIPDSystemExtension executable in the build directory THEN it SHALL return the build directory containing the executable as the bundle path
4. WHEN bundle detection runs in development environment THEN it SHALL prioritize actual executables over debug symbols

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the System Extension installation to succeed with valid bundle structures, so that I can enable USB device claiming functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system attempts to install a System Extension THEN it SHALL validate the bundle contains a proper executable
2. WHEN the bundle validation process runs THEN it SHALL accept development mode bundles with USBIPDSystemExtension executables
3. WHEN a valid development bundle is detected THEN the installation process SHALL proceed without SystemExtensionSubmissionError
4. IF the bundle path contains debug symbols THEN the system SHALL reject it as invalid for installation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear error messages and diagnostic information when System Extension operations fail, so that I can troubleshoot issues efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN bundle detection fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages indicating the cause
2. WHEN invalid bundle paths are detected THEN the system SHALL log clear warnings about dSYM vs actual bundle locations
3. WHEN System Extension installation fails THEN the diagnostic output SHALL indicate whether the issue is bundle detection or bundle validation
4. WHEN running diagnostics THEN the system SHALL display the detected bundle path and validation results

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the System Extension functionality to work reliably in production environments, so that deployed systems can claim USB devices as expected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed via Homebrew THEN bundle detection SHALL work correctly for production `.systemextension` bundles
2. WHEN production bundles are detected THEN validation SHALL verify proper bundle structure with Info.plist and executables
3. WHEN both development and production bundles are present THEN the system SHALL prioritize production bundles
4. IF no valid bundles are found THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance on installation or bundle creation

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Bundle detection logic should be clearly separated from validation logic
- **Modular Design**: Bundle detector components should be isolated and testable
- **Dependency Management**: Minimize coupling between bundle detection and System Extension installation workflows
- **Clear Interfaces**: Define clean contracts between detection, validation, and installation components

### Performance
- Bundle detection should complete within 100ms for typical development environments
- Recursive directory searches should be optimized to avoid deep traversal of build artifacts
- Bundle validation should be fast enough for interactive CLI usage

### Security
- Bundle validation must verify executable signatures and bundle integrity
- Path traversal vulnerabilities must be prevented in recursive search logic
- System Extension installation should maintain existing security constraints

### Reliability
- Bundle detection must handle missing directories gracefully
- File system errors during detection should not crash the application
- Installation failures should be recoverable and provide actionable error messages

### Usability
- Error messages should clearly indicate the specific issue (detection vs validation vs installation)
- Diagnostic commands should provide comprehensive information for troubleshooting
- Development workflow should work seamlessly without complex setup
