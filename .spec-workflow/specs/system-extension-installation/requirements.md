# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current System Extension implementation in usbipd-mac has critical flaws preventing local development and testing. The existing build process does not create proper .systemextension bundles, lacks proper code signing configuration for development environments, and provides no automated installation mechanism for developers. This specification addresses implementing a complete System Extension installation system that supports both development and production scenarios with proper code signing, bundle creation, and automated installation workflows.

The feature will enable developers to build, sign, and install the System Extension locally without manual intervention, supporting the core development workflow while maintaining compatibility with macOS security requirements.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature directly supports the product objective of **Developer Productivity** by eliminating friction in development workflows. It enables the **System Extensions Integration** key feature by providing reliable device access and claiming capabilities. The implementation aligns with the **System Integration** principle by working seamlessly with macOS security and permission models, and supports the **Production Ready** principle by focusing on reliability and proper deployment scenarios.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working on usbipd-mac, I want to build and install the System Extension automatically during development builds, so that I can test USB device claiming functionality without manual configuration steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `swift build --configuration debug` THEN the system SHALL create a properly structured .systemextension bundle in .build/debug/
2. WHEN the debug build completes THEN the system SHALL automatically sign the bundle with available development certificates
3. WHEN I run a development installation command THEN the system SHALL automatically install the System Extension with appropriate developer mode settings
4. IF no code signing certificates are available THEN the system SHALL create an unsigned bundle suitable for development mode
5. WHEN development mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL successfully load unsigned System Extension bundles for testing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer setting up the project for the first time, I want automated detection and configuration of my local development environment, so that I can start developing without complex manual setup procedures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the initial setup command THEN the system SHALL detect available code signing certificates and configure the build environment automatically
2. WHEN System Integrity Protection is disabled THEN the system SHALL warn me and provide instructions for enabling it
3. WHEN development mode is not enabled THEN the system SHALL provide automated commands to enable it with proper instructions
4. IF I lack required certificates THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for obtaining development certificates from Apple
5. WHEN the environment setup completes THEN the system SHALL verify all prerequisites are met and provide a status summary

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer testing USB device functionality, I want the System Extension to be automatically loaded and verified during testing workflows, so that integration tests can run reliably without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run integration tests THEN the system SHALL automatically verify System Extension status before executing tests
2. WHEN the System Extension is not loaded THEN the system SHALL automatically attempt to load it with appropriate error handling
3. WHEN System Extension loading fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed diagnostic information and recovery instructions
4. IF the System Extension becomes unresponsive THEN the system SHALL provide automated recovery and restart capabilities
5. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL report System Extension health status and any detected issues

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer preparing for production deployment, I want automated production signing and bundle creation workflows, so that I can create properly signed System Extensions for distribution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `swift build --configuration release` THEN the system SHALL create production-ready bundles with proper entitlements
2. WHEN production certificates are configured THEN the system SHALL automatically sign bundles with Developer ID certificates
3. WHEN notarization is configured THEN the system SHALL integrate with Apple's notarization service for distribution preparation
4. IF signing fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages with specific resolution steps
5. WHEN production builds complete THEN the system SHALL verify bundle integrity and signing status

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer troubleshooting System Extension issues, I want comprehensive diagnostic and validation tools, so that I can quickly identify and resolve installation and configuration problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run diagnostic commands THEN the system SHALL check System Extension status, bundle integrity, and signing validation
2. WHEN issues are detected THEN the system SHALL provide specific remediation steps and automated fix options where possible
3. WHEN System Extensions fail to load THEN the system SHALL parse system logs and provide relevant error information
4. IF multiple System Extensions are installed THEN the system SHALL detect conflicts and provide cleanup recommendations
5. WHEN requesting help information THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive troubleshooting guides and common solutions

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Separate build tools, code signing utilities, installation managers, and diagnostic tools into focused modules
- **Modular Design**: Create reusable components for bundle creation, signing validation, and installation workflows that can be used across different build contexts
- **Dependency Management**: Minimize dependencies on external tools beyond Xcode command line utilities and system frameworks
- **Clear Interfaces**: Define clean contracts between build plugins, signing utilities, and installation managers

### Performance
- **Build Performance**: Bundle creation and signing should add less than 30 seconds to overall build time
- **Installation Speed**: System Extension installation should complete within 60 seconds including user approval workflows
- **Diagnostic Speed**: Status checks and validation should complete within 5 seconds for responsive developer experience

### Security
- **Certificate Management**: Secure handling of code signing certificates without exposing private keys
- **Privilege Escalation**: Proper use of sudo for System Extension installation with minimal required permissions
- **Bundle Integrity**: Comprehensive validation of bundle structure, entitlements, and signing before installation
- **Development Mode Security**: Clear warnings about security implications of development mode and unsigned bundles

### Reliability
- **Error Recovery**: Robust error handling for common failure scenarios like missing certificates, permission issues, and system conflicts
- **State Management**: Reliable tracking of installation state and proper cleanup of failed installations
- **Verification**: Post-installation validation to ensure System Extension is properly loaded and functional
- **Rollback Capability**: Ability to revert to previous System Extension versions if new installations fail

### Usability
- **Developer Experience**: Clear, actionable error messages with specific resolution steps
- **Automation**: Minimal manual intervention required for common development workflows
- **Documentation Integration**: Comprehensive integration with existing SYSTEM_EXTENSION_SETUP.md documentation
- **Status Visibility**: Clear indication of current System Extension status and any required actions
