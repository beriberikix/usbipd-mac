# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Shell completions enhance developer productivity by providing intelligent tab completion for usbipd command-line arguments, options, and values. This feature will generate and distribute completion scripts for bash, zsh, and fish shells through Homebrew, making the CLI more discoverable and user-friendly. The completions will be automatically generated in the main repository and distributed via the Homebrew tap repository during the release process.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature directly supports several key product principles:

- **Developer Experience**: Provides clear, simple APIs and excellent tooling integration through intelligent shell completions
- **System Integration**: Works seamlessly with macOS default shells and popular alternatives like fish
- **Open Development**: Enhances the command-line interface accessibility for all users and contributors
- **Production Ready**: Improves usability and reduces command-line errors through intelligent completion suggestions

The feature aligns with the business objective of **Developer Productivity** by eliminating friction in CLI workflows and improving the overall user experience for developers using usbipd-mac.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Completion Script Generation

**User Story:** As a developer using usbipd, I want intelligent tab completion for commands and options, so that I can discover functionality and avoid typing errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project builds THEN the system SHALL generate completion scripts for bash, zsh, and fish shells
2. WHEN generating completions THEN the system SHALL include all available commands, subcommands, and options
3. WHEN generating completions THEN the system SHALL include contextual value suggestions where applicable (e.g., device IDs, network addresses)
4. WHEN Swift ArgumentParser is used THEN the system SHALL leverage built-in completion generation capabilities

### Requirement 2: Homebrew Integration

**User Story:** As a macOS user installing usbipd via Homebrew, I want shell completions automatically installed, so that I get enhanced CLI experience without manual setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN usbipd is installed via Homebrew THEN the system SHALL install completion scripts to appropriate shell directories
2. WHEN using bash THEN completions SHALL be installed to `#{bash_completion}/usbipd`
3. WHEN using zsh THEN completions SHALL be installed to `#{zsh_completion}/_usbipd`
4. WHEN using fish THEN completions SHALL be installed to `#{fish_completion}/usbipd.fish`
5. WHEN completions are installed THEN they SHALL be immediately available in new shell sessions

### Requirement 3: Release Automation Integration

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want completion scripts automatically updated and distributed during releases, so that users always have current completions without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a release is prepared THEN the system SHALL generate fresh completion scripts
2. WHEN release artifacts are built THEN completion scripts SHALL be included in the distribution
3. WHEN the Homebrew formula is updated THEN completion installation SHALL be included in the formula
4. WHEN the tap repository is updated THEN completion scripts SHALL be pushed alongside the formula changes

### Requirement 4: Cross-Shell Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer using different shell environments, I want consistent completion behavior across bash, zsh, and fish, so that my workflow remains predictable regardless of shell choice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using bash completion THEN the system SHALL provide command, option, and value completions
2. WHEN using zsh completion THEN the system SHALL provide enhanced completions with descriptions
3. WHEN using fish completion THEN the system SHALL provide intelligent completions with context-aware suggestions
4. WHEN switching between shells THEN completion functionality SHALL remain consistent
5. WHEN completion scripts are malformed THEN they SHALL fail gracefully without breaking shell functionality

### Requirement 5: Dynamic Value Completion

**User Story:** As a user running usbipd commands, I want intelligent completion of dynamic values like device IDs and IP addresses, so that I can quickly select from available options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN completing device-related commands THEN the system SHALL suggest available USB device IDs
2. WHEN completing network-related options THEN the system SHALL suggest common IP address formats
3. WHEN completing file paths THEN the system SHALL use standard file completion
4. WHEN dynamic completion fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to basic option completion

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Completion generation should be isolated in a dedicated module
- **Modular Design**: Completion logic should be separate from core CLI command implementation
- **Dependency Management**: Use Swift ArgumentParser's built-in completion capabilities where possible
- **Clear Interfaces**: Define clean contracts between CLI commands and completion generation

### Performance
- Completion generation must complete within 5 seconds during build process
- Shell completion queries must respond within 100ms for responsive user experience
- Dynamic value completion must not significantly impact CLI startup time

### Security
- Completion scripts must not expose sensitive information or credentials
- Dynamic completion must validate user permissions before suggesting device IDs
- Generated scripts must not execute arbitrary code or commands

### Reliability
- Completion generation must not fail the build process if completion cannot be generated
- Malformed completion scripts must not break shell functionality
- Completion installation must be atomic and recoverable if interrupted

### Usability
- Completions must follow shell-specific conventions and patterns
- Error messages from completion failures must be clear and actionable
- Documentation must include setup instructions for each supported shell
