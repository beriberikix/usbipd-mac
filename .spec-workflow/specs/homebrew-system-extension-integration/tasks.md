# Implementation Plan

## Task Overview

This implementation plan systematically builds the Homebrew System Extension integration by enhancing the existing Homebrew formula, creating installation utilities, and adding comprehensive CI validation. The approach leverages existing SystemExtensionBundleCreator infrastructure while adding Homebrew-specific packaging and automation.
