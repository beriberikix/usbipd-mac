# Implementation Plan

## Task Overview

The implementation follows a systematic approach to build the automated production release system with proper Git workflow integration. Tasks are organized in dependency order, starting with feature branch creation and spec file commits, then core GitHub Actions workflows, release preparation tooling, comprehensive testing, and finally PR creation with CI validation. Each task includes explicit Git operations to maintain proper version control throughout the implementation.
