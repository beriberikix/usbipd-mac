# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for implementing an automated production release system for usbipd-mac using GitHub Actions. The feature will transform the current manual release process into a fully automated, reliable, and secure workflow that can produce production-ready releases with minimal human intervention.

The system will provide a complete release pipeline from code validation through artifact creation, distribution, and post-release tasks, ensuring consistent, high-quality releases while reducing the operational burden on maintainers.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature directly supports the project's business objectives of establishing usbipd-mac as the canonical USB/IP solution for macOS by:

- **Open Source Leadership**: Providing professional-grade release automation that demonstrates project maturity
- **Community Growth**: Enabling frequent, reliable releases that keep users engaged and attract new contributors
- **Enterprise Adoption**: Delivering the release consistency and security that enterprise users require
- **Developer Productivity**: Reducing manual release overhead so maintainers can focus on feature development

The automated release system aligns with the product principle of "Production Ready" by ensuring releases are thoroughly validated and consistently packaged.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Automated Release Workflow

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want to trigger production releases through Git tags or manual dispatch, so that I can create consistent releases without manual artifact building.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a semantic version tag (v*.*.* pattern) is pushed THEN the system SHALL trigger the complete release workflow automatically
2. WHEN a maintainer uses workflow_dispatch with version input THEN the system SHALL create a release using the specified version
3. WHEN the workflow is triggered THEN the system SHALL support both regular releases and pre-releases through configuration
4. IF pre-release is indicated by version tag or manual input THEN the system SHALL mark the release appropriately in GitHub

### Requirement 2: Comprehensive Release Validation

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want automated validation before releases, so that only high-quality code reaches production users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN release workflow starts THEN the system SHALL run SwiftLint with strict validation before proceeding
2. WHEN code quality passes THEN the system SHALL build all targets with release configuration and verify success
3. WHEN build succeeds THEN the system SHALL execute the complete test suite (development, CI, and production environments)
4. IF any validation step fails THEN the system SHALL halt the release workflow and report specific failures
5. WHEN validation includes security scanning THEN the system SHALL check for dependency vulnerabilities and hardcoded secrets

### Requirement 3: Multi-Target Artifact Building

**User Story:** As a user downloading releases, I want properly built and signed binaries for all components, so that I can install and use the software reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building release artifacts THEN the system SHALL compile optimized release binaries for usbipd, QEMUTestServer, and USBIPDSystemExtension
2. WHEN creating System Extension bundle THEN the system SHALL package USBIPDSystemExtension.app with proper directory structure and resources
3. WHEN generating artifacts THEN the system SHALL create SHA256 checksums for all binaries for integrity verification
4. WHEN artifacts are ready THEN the system SHALL package everything into a versioned distribution archive
5. IF code signing is configured THEN the system SHALL sign all binaries with appropriate certificates and entitlements

### Requirement 4: GitHub Release Publishing

**User Story:** As a user seeking software releases, I want professionally formatted GitHub releases with comprehensive information, so that I can understand what's new and how to install it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN publishing releases THEN the system SHALL generate release notes automatically from Git commit history since the previous release
2. WHEN creating release content THEN the system SHALL include installation instructions, system requirements, and component descriptions
3. WHEN uploading artifacts THEN the system SHALL attach the distribution archive, individual binaries, and checksum files
4. WHEN release is published THEN the system SHALL use appropriate release/pre-release designation based on version format
5. IF release publication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages for manual intervention

### Requirement 5: Pre-Release Validation System

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want automated validation on pull requests and release candidates, so that I can catch issues before they reach production releases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pull requests are opened to main branch THEN the system SHALL run quick validation (linting, building, development tests)
2. WHEN comprehensive validation is requested THEN the system SHALL run the complete test suite matching release validation
3. WHEN validation completes THEN the system SHALL report clear pass/fail status with detailed logs for any failures
4. IF validation fails THEN the system SHALL prevent merge until issues are resolved
5. WHEN release candidates need validation THEN the system SHALL provide manual workflow dispatch for full validation

### Requirement 6: Release Preparation Tooling

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want local tooling to prepare releases safely, so that I can validate everything before triggering the automated workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN preparing releases locally THEN the system SHALL provide a script that validates environment and prerequisites
2. WHEN running preparation THEN the system SHALL check code quality, build status, and test results before proceeding
3. WHEN creating release tags THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate Git tags with version validation and changelog integration
4. IF preparation detects issues THEN the system SHALL halt and report specific problems for resolution
5. WHEN preparation completes THEN the system SHALL provide clear next steps for triggering the automated release

### Requirement 7: Security and Code Signing

**User Story:** As a user installing software, I want properly signed binaries that validate authenticity, so that I can trust the software's integrity and origin.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN signing is configured THEN the system SHALL sign all executables with Apple Developer certificates
2. WHEN creating System Extension bundle THEN the system SHALL apply proper entitlements and bundle signing
3. WHEN publishing releases THEN the system SHALL include signature verification instructions in release notes
4. IF signing credentials are missing THEN the system SHALL create development-signed artifacts with clear warnings
5. WHEN handling secrets THEN the system SHALL use GitHub Secrets for secure credential management

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each workflow job should handle one specific phase (validation, building, publishing)
- **Modular Design**: Workflow steps should be reusable and independently testable
- **Dependency Management**: Clear dependency ordering between workflow jobs with proper error propagation
- **Clear Interfaces**: Well-defined inputs and outputs for each workflow step and script

### Performance
- **Workflow Execution Time**: Complete release workflow should finish within 15 minutes for typical releases
- **Artifact Build Time**: Binary compilation should complete within 5 minutes using GitHub Actions runners
- **Parallel Execution**: Independent validation steps should run in parallel to minimize total execution time
- **Cache Utilization**: Swift package dependencies should be cached to reduce repeated download time

### Security
- **Credential Management**: All signing certificates and tokens must be stored securely in GitHub Secrets
- **Artifact Integrity**: All release artifacts must include cryptographic checksums for verification
- **Access Control**: Release workflows should only run on authorized repositories with proper branch protection
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Automated scanning for known security vulnerabilities in dependencies

### Reliability
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure handling with clear error reporting and recovery suggestions
- **Idempotent Operations**: Release steps should be safely repeatable without side effects
