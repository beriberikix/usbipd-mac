   - Eliminated WEBHOOK_TOKEN secret requirement
   - Archived webhook workflows in tap repository

2. **homebrew-releaser Integration** (Tasks 3-6)
   - Configured automated formula updates using GitHub Actions
   - Tested with dry-run validation
   - Validated with test releases v0.0.6 and v0.0.7
   - Confirmed seamless user installation workflow

3. **Production Optimization** (Task 12)
   - Disabled debug logging for production
   - Enhanced monitoring with automatic issue creation
   - Configured dedicated HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN

4. **Documentation and Rollback** (Tasks 10-11)
   - Updated all documentation to reflect new architecture
   - Created comprehensive rollback procedures (3 levels)
   - Validated rollback scripts and procedures

### ðŸ”„ Validation Phase (Task 13-14)
- **CI Pipeline**: âœ… All tests pass (SwiftLint: 0 violations, Build: successful)
- **Pull Request**: âœ… Created and ready for merge
- **Release Cycle**: Ready for first homebrew-releaser release

## Monitoring Checklist

### Formula Update Success Rate
- [ ] **First Release Post-Merge**: Monitor GitHub Actions workflow execution
- [ ] **Formula Update Timing**: Track homebrew-releaser execution time (target: <2 minutes)
- [ ] **Error Rate**: Ensure 0 failures in formula updates
- [ ] **Rollback Readiness**: Keep rollback scripts validated and ready

### User Installation Success
- [ ] **Tap Repository**: Verify `brew tap beriberikix/usbipd-mac` works correctly
- [ ] **Formula Installation**: Test `brew install usbipd-mac` with new versions
- [ ] **Version Consistency**: Ensure formula version matches GitHub releases
- [ ] **System Extension**: Verify System Extension installation workflow remains intact

### Workflow Monitoring
- [ ] **GitHub Actions**: Monitor `.github/workflows/release.yml` execution
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Validate automatic issue creation on failures
- [ ] **Token Validation**: Ensure HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN has proper permissions
- [ ] **Commit Quality**: Verify commit messages follow conventional commit format

## Success Metrics

### Performance Targets
- **Formula Update Time**: â‰¤ 2 minutes (vs. previous webhook: ~1-3 minutes)
- **Release Workflow Time**: â‰¤ 10 minutes total (including homebrew-releaser step)
- **Error Rate**: 0% for formula updates
- **User Installation Success**: >99% success rate

### Quality Indicators
- **Formula Accuracy**: Version, URL, and SHA256 checksums always correct
- **Commit Messages**: Consistent formatting with conventional commit style
- **Issue Creation**: Automatic issues created for any failures
- **Documentation**: No user confusion about installation process

## Current Status (as of August 21, 2025)

### Release Workflow Status
- **Latest Release**: v0.0.13 (still using webhook system)
- **Formula Version**: v0.0.11 (last successful webhook update)
- **Migration Branch**: feature/homebrew-releaser-migration (ready for merge)
- **Next Milestone**: First release using homebrew-releaser exclusively

### Infrastructure Status
- **Main Repository**: âœ… Webhook code removed, homebrew-releaser integrated
- **Tap Repository**: âœ… Webhook workflows archived, ready for homebrew-releaser
- **GitHub Secrets**: âœ… HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN configured, WEBHOOK_TOKEN removed
- **Documentation**: âœ… All references updated to reflect new architecture

### User Impact Assessment
- **Installation Process**: No changes for users (`brew install` workflow identical)
- **System Extension**: No changes to System Extension installation
- **Service Management**: No changes to `brew services` commands
- **Troubleshooting**: Simplified architecture reduces potential failure points

## Early Adopter Feedback Collection

### Feedback Channels
1. **GitHub Issues**: Monitor for installation or functionality reports
2. **Community Feedback**: Track any social media or community discussions
3. **Error Logs**: Monitor GitHub Actions failure notifications
4. **Performance Metrics**: Track formula update timing and success rates

### Key Questions for Users
- Does `brew install usbipd-mac` work as expected with new releases?
- Are formula updates appearing within expected timeframes?
- Is the System Extension installation process unchanged?
- Any performance or reliability differences noticed?

## Rollback Procedures

### Quick Reference
- **Level 1 (Configuration)**: Revert homebrew-releaser config, restore webhook in 5 minutes
- **Level 2 (Partial)**: Full webhook restoration in 15 minutes  
- **Level 3 (Full)**: Complete architecture rollback in 30 minutes

### Rollback Scripts
```bash
# Validate rollback capability
ROLLBACK_LEVEL=configuration ./Scripts/validate-rollback.sh

# Execute rollback if needed
./Scripts/rollback-release.sh --type configuration
```

## Next Steps

1. **Merge PR #25**: Complete the migration implementation
2. **Create Test Release**: Trigger first homebrew-releaser workflow
3. **Monitor Initial Release**: Validate formula update process
4. **Collect User Feedback**: Gather installation experience reports
5. **Update Monitoring**: Refine success metrics based on real data
