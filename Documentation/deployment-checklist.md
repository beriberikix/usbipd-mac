# Deployment Checklist and Rollback Procedures

## Homebrew-Releaser Integration Deployment Guide

This document provides comprehensive deployment procedures for the homebrew-releaser GitHub Action integration. It includes validation checkpoints, rollback procedures, and troubleshooting guidance for safe production deployment.

**Note**: This document is archived as it was created for the webhook-based architecture. The current architecture uses homebrew-releaser which is simpler and more reliable. See [homebrew-releaser-setup.md](homebrew-releaser-setup.md) for current configuration.

}'
```

## Rollback Procedures

### ðŸš¨ Emergency Rollback Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Webhook Integration Failure
**Symptoms**: Webhook not triggering, formula not updating
**Immediate Actions**:
1. **Manual Formula Update**:
   ```bash
   # Clone tap repository
   git clone https://github.com/beriberikix/homebrew-usbipd-mac.git
   cd homebrew-usbipd-mac
   
   # Manual update with latest release
   ./Scripts/manual-update.sh --version v[LATEST] --force
   
   # Commit and push
   git add Formula/usbipd-mac.rb
   git commit -m "emergency: manual formula update for v[LATEST]"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **User Communication**:
   ```bash
   # Update users via GitHub issue/announcement
   gh issue create --repo beriberikix/usbipd-mac \
     --title "Temporary Installation Instructions" \
     --body "Temporary manual update in progress..."
   ```

#### Scenario 2: Formula Installation Failures
**Symptoms**: Users cannot install via tap, build failures
**Immediate Actions**:
1. **Revert Formula Changes**:
   ```bash
   cd homebrew-usbipd-mac
   git log --oneline -5
   git revert [COMMIT_HASH]
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Emergency Formula Fix**:
   ```bash
   # Quick syntax fix if needed
   ruby -c Formula/usbipd-mac.rb
   # Fix issues and commit immediately
   ```

#### Scenario 3: Complete Architecture Rollback
**Symptoms**: Fundamental issues requiring full rollback
**Immediate Actions**:
1. **Restore Formula Directory**:
   ```bash
   # In main repository
   git checkout main
   git revert [MERGE_COMMIT] --no-edit
   
   # Restore Formula directory from backup or recreate
   mkdir Formula
   # Copy working formula from tap repository
   curl -o Formula/usbipd-mac.rb \
     https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beriberikix/homebrew-usbipd-mac/main/Formula/usbipd-mac.rb
   
   # Update placeholders with current version
   sed -i 's/VERSION_PLACEHOLDER/v[CURRENT]/g' Formula/usbipd-mac.rb
   sed -i 's/SHA256_PLACEHOLDER/[CURRENT_SHA]/g' Formula/usbipd-mac.rb
   
   git add Formula/
   git commit -m "emergency: restore embedded Formula directory"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Update Release Workflow**:
   ```bash
   # Restore original formula update workflow
   git checkout [BACKUP_COMMIT] -- .github/workflows/release.yml
   git commit -m "emergency: restore original release workflow"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **User Communication**:
   ```bash
   # Immediate user notification
   gh issue create --repo beriberikix/usbipd-mac \
     --title "ðŸš¨ Emergency: Installation Method Temporarily Reverted" \
     --body "Due to technical issues, we have temporarily reverted to the original installation method..."
   ```

### ðŸ“‹ Rollback Validation Checklist

After any rollback procedure:
- [ ] **CI Pipeline**: Verify CI passes with rollback changes
- [ ] **Installation Test**: Confirm users can install successfully
- [ ] **Existing Users**: Verify existing installations unaffected
- [ ] **Documentation**: Update documentation to reflect temporary changes
- [ ] **Communication**: Notify users of rollback and timeline for resolution
- [ ] **Root Cause Analysis**: Document what went wrong and prevention measures

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: Webhook Not Triggering
**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Check webhook configuration
gh api repos/beriberikix/usbipd-mac/hooks

# Check recent deliveries
gh api repos/beriberikix/usbipd-mac/hooks/[HOOK_ID]/deliveries | jq '.[0]'
```

**Solutions**:
1. Verify webhook URL is correct
2. Check repository permissions
3. Validate event triggers (release, published)
4. Use manual workflow dispatch as workaround

#### Issue: Formula Validation Failures
**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Check formula syntax
ruby -c Formula/usbipd-mac.rb

# Validate with Homebrew
brew audit --strict Formula/usbipd-mac.rb
```

**Solutions**:
1. Fix Ruby syntax errors
2. Update formula structure
3. Verify all required fields present
4. Test with clean Homebrew installation

#### Issue: Metadata Generation Failures
**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Test metadata generation locally
./Scripts/generate-homebrew-metadata.sh --version v[TEST] --dry-run --verbose

# Check for missing dependencies
which jq curl shasum
```

**Solutions**:
1. Install missing dependencies
2. Fix script permissions
3. Verify Git tag exists
4. Check network connectivity for downloads
