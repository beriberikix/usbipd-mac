# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for the usbipd-mac project. The pipeline will provide automated validation of code quality, successful builds, and test execution on every pull request and push to the main branch. The focus is on supporting the latest versions of Swift and macOS to ensure the project stays current with the platform while maintaining fast feedback cycles for developers.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated code quality checks on every pull request, so that I can maintain consistent code style and catch issues early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pull request is created THEN the system SHALL run SwiftLint to validate code style
2. WHEN SwiftLint finds violations THEN the system SHALL fail the check and report specific violations with line numbers and descriptions
3. WHEN code passes SwiftLint validation THEN the system SHALL mark the check as successful
4. IF SwiftLint is not available THEN the system SHALL install it automatically using Homebrew during the workflow
5. WHEN SwiftLint configuration changes THEN the system SHALL use the updated rules from the project's .swiftlint.yml file

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated builds on every code change, so that I can ensure the project compiles successfully across different scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to main branch THEN the system SHALL build the project using Swift Package Manager
2. WHEN a pull request is created THEN the system SHALL build the project to validate compilation
3. WHEN build fails THEN the system SHALL report the specific build errors and fail the workflow
4. WHEN build succeeds THEN the system SHALL mark the build check as successful
5. IF dependencies are missing THEN the system SHALL resolve them automatically before building

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated test execution on every code change, so that I can catch regressions and ensure functionality works as expected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed or pull request is created THEN the system SHALL run all unit tests
2. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL report which tests failed and why
3. WHEN all tests pass THEN the system SHALL mark the test check as successful
4. WHEN integration tests are available THEN the system SHALL run them as part of the test suite
5. IF test dependencies are missing THEN the system SHALL set them up automatically

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want the CI pipeline to use the latest Swift and macOS versions, so that the project stays current with platform capabilities and requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the workflow runs THEN the system SHALL use the latest stable version of macOS available on GitHub Actions
2. WHEN the workflow runs THEN the system SHALL use the latest stable version of Swift available
3. WHEN new versions become available THEN the system SHALL be easily updatable to use them
4. IF the latest versions are not compatible THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want fast feedback from CI checks, so that I can iterate quickly on code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the workflow runs THEN the system SHALL complete linting, building, and testing in under 10 minutes for typical changes
2. WHEN possible THEN the system SHALL run checks in parallel to reduce total execution time
3. WHEN dependencies are cached THEN the system SHALL reuse them to speed up subsequent runs
4. WHEN workflow fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want the CI pipeline to prevent broken code from being merged, so that the main branch remains stable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pull request has failing checks THEN the system SHALL prevent merging until checks pass
2. WHEN all checks pass THEN the system SHALL allow the pull request to be merged
3. WHEN checks are running THEN the system SHALL show the current status clearly
4. IF checks are skipped or bypassed THEN the system SHALL require explicit approval from maintainers
