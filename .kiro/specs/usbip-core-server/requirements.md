# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The USB/IP core server functionality MVP aims to implement the minimal viable product for a USB/IP server on macOS. This implementation will allow clients to connect to the server and discover USB devices, but will not yet include actual USB device interaction functionality. The core server will implement the basic USB/IP protocol communication layer, network handling, and device enumeration capabilities, providing a foundation for future complete USB device sharing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: USB/IP Protocol Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement the core USB/IP protocol message formats, so that the server can communicate with USB/IP clients according to the specification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parsing a USB/IP protocol message THEN the system SHALL correctly interpret all required fields according to the USB/IP protocol specification.
2. WHEN generating a USB/IP protocol message THEN the system SHALL create properly formatted messages according to the USB/IP protocol specification.
3. WHEN receiving an unsupported or malformed message THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and log appropriate information.
4. WHEN implementing protocol structures THEN the system SHALL use proper Swift data types that match the USB/IP protocol specification requirements.
5. WHEN encoding/decoding protocol messages THEN the system SHALL handle endianness conversion correctly as specified in the USB/IP protocol.

### Requirement 2: Network Communication

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the server to handle network connections properly, so that clients can establish stable connections to the USB/IP server.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client attempts to connect THEN the system SHALL accept TCP connections on the standard USB/IP port (3240).
2. WHEN multiple clients attempt to connect simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent connections appropriately.
3. WHEN a network error occurs THEN the system SHALL log the error and attempt to recover or gracefully terminate the connection.
4. WHEN implementing socket communication THEN the system SHALL use non-blocking I/O to prevent hanging on network operations.
5. WHEN a client disconnects THEN the system SHALL clean up resources and handle the disconnection gracefully.

### Requirement 3: Device Discovery and Enumeration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to list available USB devices on the server, so that I can see what devices are available for potential sharing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client requests device listing THEN the system SHALL return a list of USB devices connected to the macOS host.
2. WHEN enumerating devices THEN the system SHALL include device details such as vendor ID, product ID, and device class.
3. WHEN a USB device is connected or disconnected THEN the system SHALL detect these changes and update the device list accordingly.
4. WHEN retrieving device information THEN the system SHALL use IOKit to access accurate USB device information.
5. WHEN a client requests detailed information about a specific device THEN the system SHALL provide all required USB/IP device attributes.

### Requirement 4: Command-Line Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want a command-line interface that follows Linux usbipd CLI conventions, so that I can control the server operation with familiar commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CLI is launched with the "usbipd" command THEN the system SHALL display help information if no arguments are provided.
2. WHEN the CLI is launched with the "usbipd list" command THEN the system SHALL display all available USB devices with their details in a format compatible with Linux usbipd.
3. WHEN the CLI is launched with the "usbipd bind" command THEN the system SHALL prepare the specified device for sharing (placeholder for MVP).
4. WHEN the CLI is launched with the "usbipd unbind" command THEN the system SHALL stop sharing the specified device (placeholder for MVP).
5. WHEN the CLI is launched with the "usbipd attach" command THEN the system SHALL log the request (placeholder for MVP).
6. WHEN the CLI is launched with the "usbipd detach" command THEN the system SHALL log the request (placeholder for MVP).
7. WHEN the CLI is launched with the "usbipd daemon" command THEN the system SHALL start the USB/IP server process in daemon mode.
8. WHEN the CLI encounters an error THEN the system SHALL display meaningful error messages in a format consistent with Linux usbipd.

### Requirement 5: Logging and Diagnostics

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive logging of server operations, so that I can diagnose issues and monitor server behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any significant event occurs THEN the system SHALL log the event with appropriate severity level.
2. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including context to aid debugging.
3. WHEN the log level is configured THEN the system SHALL respect the configured verbosity settings.
4. WHEN the server is running in debug mode THEN the system SHALL include protocol-level details in the logs.
5. WHEN implementing logging THEN the system SHALL use a consistent logging format that includes timestamps, severity, and context information.

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Stability

**User Story:** As a user, I want the server to be stable and handle errors gracefully, so that it can run reliably without crashing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an unexpected error occurs THEN the system SHALL catch the error and prevent application crashes.
2. WHEN a client sends invalid data THEN the system SHALL reject the request with an appropriate error message without crashing.
3. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL degrade gracefully rather than failing completely.
4. WHEN the server encounters a critical error THEN the system SHALL log the error and attempt to recover or shut down gracefully.
5. WHEN implementing error handling THEN the system SHALL use Swift's error handling mechanisms consistently.
