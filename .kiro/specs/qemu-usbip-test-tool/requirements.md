# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a minimal QEMU-based testing tool that can act as a USB/IP client to validate the functionality of the usbipd-mac server. The tool will provide automated testing capabilities through simple shell scripts and standardized output mechanisms for test validation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a minimal QEMU instance that can connect as a USB/IP client, so that I can validate my USB/IP server implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the QEMU instance is started THEN it SHALL boot a minimal Linux system with USB/IP client support
2. WHEN the system boots THEN it SHALL automatically load the vhci-hcd kernel module
3. WHEN the USB/IP client tools are available THEN the system SHALL be able to connect to a USB/IP server
4. IF cloud-init is available THEN the system SHALL use cloud-init for the simplest possible configuration

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated scripts to manage the QEMU test environment, so that I can easily create and start test instances without manual configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the image creation script THEN it SHALL create a minimal bootable QEMU image with USB/IP client capabilities
2. WHEN I run the startup script THEN it SHALL launch the QEMU instance with appropriate network configuration for USB/IP testing
3. WHEN the scripts execute THEN they SHALL handle common error conditions gracefully
4. WHEN the image creation completes THEN it SHALL produce a reusable disk image for testing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a test automation system, I want standardized output from the QEMU instance, so that I can programmatically validate USB/IP server functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the QEMU instance performs USB/IP operations THEN it SHALL output structured log messages to a predictable location
2. WHEN USB/IP client commands are executed THEN the system SHALL provide clear success/failure indicators
3. WHEN tests need to validate functionality THEN they SHALL be able to access QEMU output through standard mechanisms (serial console, log files, or network)
4. WHEN the QEMU instance encounters errors THEN it SHALL report them in a format suitable for automated parsing

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the QEMU tool to integrate with the existing project structure, so that it fits seamlessly into the usbipd-mac testing workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tool is implemented THEN it SHALL follow the project's directory structure conventions
2. WHEN scripts are created THEN they SHALL be placed in the Scripts/ directory alongside existing build tools
3. WHEN the tool runs THEN it SHALL be compatible with the existing CI/CD pipeline
4. WHEN the tool runs in GitHub Actions THEN it SHALL execute successfully in the CI environment with appropriate virtualization support
5. WHEN documentation is needed THEN it SHALL follow the project's documentation standards

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the QEMU instance to have minimal resource requirements, so that it can run efficiently in development and CI environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the QEMU instance starts THEN it SHALL use minimal memory allocation suitable for CI environments
2. WHEN the disk image is created THEN it SHALL be as small as possible while maintaining functionality
3. WHEN the system boots THEN it SHALL start quickly without unnecessary services
4. WHEN multiple instances are needed THEN the tool SHALL support concurrent execution without resource conflicts
